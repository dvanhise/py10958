# Is using square root cheating within the rules of the problem?
# Adding an arbitrary ^2 would not be allowed unless that was the two
# in the number set, so ^(1/2) seems even more wrong.  It's only
# redeeming factor is that the written form of square root only
# consists of a symbol (âˆš), making it more similar to factorial (!).

# Since the problem itself isn't too mathematically serious, I'm keeping it.
